# Trading agent — known gaps (documented, not closed)

Residual issues that are understood and deliberately left open. Each entry
says why it isn't fixed here and what would close it. Remove entries only
when actually closed, not when they become inconvenient.

## Phase 4 — News/Sentiment (logged 2026-08-21)

1. **Article bodies are not point-in-time bounded.** Finnhub returns each
   article as it exists *now*. A piece published before the probe date may
   have been updated after it (corrected figure, revised headline, appended
   "UPDATE:" paragraph); the publish-date filter cannot see this. A genuine
   residual lookahead channel, not fixable without a point-in-time news
   archive. (Inference about how Finnhub serves content — not verified
   against their docs.)

2. **Summary faithfulness is unverified.** The index-join in
   `news_digest_port.py` guarantees the metadata is real; nothing checks
   that Haiku's one-line summary accurately represents the article body.
   Lower stakes than the fundamentals numbers, but it is a fabrication
   surface with no verifier. Closing it would need a second model call per
   article, which isn't worth it at this node's stakes.

3. **[Largely resolved] Truncation is a sampling bias, not just a cap.**
   A newest-first cap means a busy week silently drops older-but-possibly-
   more-important coverage. `truncated_by_cap` makes it visible (and now
   surfaces in the vault sentiment report as a caveat); it doesn't make it
   correct.

   *Measured on the first live run (MSFT, 2026-08-21):* Finnhub returned
   **247 articles** for a 14-day window. The cap kept 60 and dropped 187,
   collapsing the effective window from 14 days to **5 days**
   (2026-08-17..08-21). Worse, 2026-08-13 alone had **101 articles** — an
   obvious event spike — and the cap discards that entire day. For a
   mega-cap the cap is not a safety valve, it is the dominant sampling
   decision. Consider a per-day quota or event-aware selection rather than
   a flat newest-first cut.

   *Also measured:* dedup removed **0 of 247**. The guide expected
   syndicated reprints to be a large share; across Yahoo/Benzinga/
   SeekingAlpha the headlines differ enough that exact-headline dedup never
   fires. Dedup is cheap and harmless, but it is not the cost lever it was
   assumed to be — the cap is.

   **[Resolved 2026-08-22] `MAX_ARTICLES` raised 60 → 300.** Relevance
   scoring (gap 5) had made the cost of the old cap precise: of MSFT's 247
   in-window articles, 58 named Microsoft and the cap kept **6** of them,
   leaving a signal that was correct but too thin to use (three of the six
   were near-identical "Microsoft Versus Competitors" template pieces).

   300 is derived from the budget rather than picked for roundness. Worst
   case is ~$0.00042/article plus a 496-token system prompt per batch, so a
   full-cap run costs ~$0.136 — about 68% of `NEWS_BUDGET_USD`. That
   ordering matters: the budget assertion fires only *after* the batches are
   paid for, so it can never refund a run it fails. Keeping the cap strictly
   inside the budget means volume degrades to flagged truncation instead of
   an exception charged at full price.

   *Verified live (MSFT, 2026-08-22):* 248 articles fetched, **248 in the
   digest**, `truncated_by_cap=False`, 11 distinct days covered instead of
   5, and **54 primary articles instead of 6**. net_score +0.407 over n=54.
   Cost $0.0997 (50% of budget); measured $0.000402/article, within 0.3% of
   the AVGO figure the estimate was built on. Wall clock 24.7s for 17
   batches at concurrency 5 — the batches were made concurrent in the same
   change, since 20 sequential calls would otherwise have put the node into
   the minutes.

   *Residual:* a ticker with more than 300 in-window articles still
   truncates, still newest-first, and still flags it. The rejected
   alternative was prioritizing likely-relevant articles before the cap,
   which keeps cost flat but needs the company *name* — matching the ticker
   alone found only 8 of MSFT's 58, because headlines say "Microsoft", not
   "MSFT" — so it requires a name lookup (e.g. Finnhub `/stock/profile2`)
   plus a cache. A per-day quota instead of a flat newest-first cut remains
   the cheapest way to stop an event day being dropped wholesale if the cap
   ever binds again.

4. **News is single-vendor.** Phase 3's price fetch has a yfinance/Finnhub
   router; news has no fallback, so a Finnhub outage kills the node.
   Acceptable for now — but `VendorError` from this node needs a decided
   policy in Phase 7: does the pipeline halt, or produce a memo flagged
   "news unavailable"? Decide explicitly rather than discovering the
   default.

5. **[Addressed] Finnhub's `company-news` feed is mostly not about the
   company.** Found on the first live run, not anticipated in the design.
   For MSFT (2026-08-21, 60 articles reaching the digest) 75% had no
   Microsoft signal at all — Ferrari, Alibaba, Walmart, Netflix,
   McDonald's, 13F trackers, index-movers columns — yet Finnhub tagged
   **all 60** with `related: "MSFT"`, so that field cannot filter.

   Two causes, both now fixed. The prompt never named the company, so the
   model scored each article against whichever company it was about; the
   batch now leads with `COMPANY UNDER ANALYSIS`. And there was no way to
   separate company news from sector news, so `NewsItem.relevance`
   (primary/mentioned/unrelated) is scored in the same call and
   `sentiment_node` aggregates only `AGGREGATED_RELEVANCE`.

   Residual, worth knowing: LLM relevance agreed with a plain
   "does the headline name the company" check **6/6 on MSFT and 10/10 on
   FIG**, with no disagreement either way. So for the current primary-only
   policy the model is not yet earning its keep over a free regex — it is
   free (same call), but the judgement it uniquely adds lives in the
   `mentioned` tier, which nothing currently consumes. If Phase 5 wants
   sector context as a separate signal, that tier is where it is.

6. **[Phase 3 residual] The price fetch is not `as_of_date`-bounded.**
   `technical_node` fetches ~1 year of history with no upper bound and
   derives its `as_of_date` from `df.index[-1]`. Now that `as_of_date`
   lives in `TradingState`, a probe run (`--as-of 2025-03-01`) gets news
   bounded at March 2025 alongside price data through today — a real
   lookahead hole in any historical probe. Fix when historical backtesting
   is actually needed, not before.

## Phase 5 — Bull/Bear Debate (logged 2026-08-23)

1. **Convergence is mitigated, not eliminated.** The §5 guardrails raise the
   cost of unjustified agreement — a concession must name a real opposing
   `claim_id`, a claim must quote the report it cites, a figure must appear
   in the evidence pack — but they cannot make two instances of one base
   model independent. They share priors. A transcript where both sides
   converge on a correct conclusion and one where they converge from shared
   bias are indistinguishable from inside the transcript.

2. **The number guard has an unmeasured false-positive rate.** Containment
   plus a precision-scoped rounding clearance plus the Phase 3 percent
   transforms. Three classes found and closed so far, each from live output:
   rounding ("RSI of 41.2" for 41.2033), percent-against-percent, and
   hyphenated compounds ("the low-30s", "sub-50-SMA" read as -30 and -50).
   Expect more — "roughly $12B" for 12.2, unit changes. Until measured, a
   non-empty `guard_flags` means *review*, not *fabricated*.

   *Measured (AVGO, 2026-08-23, 6 turns over the technical report alone):*
   6 flags, of which 4 were the same derived figure and 2 were the hyphen
   bug. So **1 distinct true positive and 1 distinct false-positive class**,
   and the guard is currently dominated by arithmetic the debaters do on
   pack values — 368.45 − 368.30 = 0.15, correctly flagged under "cite,
   don't compute", but benign on inspection. Watch whether that shape
   trains readers to skip the flags; if it does, the answer is a separate
   "derived from pack values" category rather than dropping the rule.

3. **Both sides held for all six turns; nothing conceded, nothing
   sharpened.** The first live debate produced `stance="hold"` 6/6 and zero
   concessions. The §5(a) guard makes an *unjustified* concession
   impossible, but nothing makes a justified one attractive, and total
   entrenchment is as uninformative as convergence — it just fails in the
   opposite direction. `claim_id` reuse worked (gap 5 below did not
   materialize), so the early-stop lever is live; the stance field is not
   yet doing any work. Watch across more runs before changing the prompt.

4. **Containment cannot catch a correctly-quoted figure used wrongly.**
   Right number, wrong period or wrong entity. Same period-consistency gap
   `ask_edgar` has, now one layer further downstream.

5. **`claim_id` reuse is prompt-dependent.** A model inventing a fresh slug
   for a restated claim inflates `productive` and defeats the early stop. It
   fails toward *more* rounds, capped at `MAX_TURNS` — a safe direction, but
   the early-stop lever is weaker than it reads.

6. **Order bias is unquantified.** Bull speaks first and bear gets the last
   rebuttal in each round. Full mitigation doubles cost. Run one ticker
   bear-first by hand, compare the surviving claim sets, and put the number
   here before building any machinery.

7. **Nothing downstream re-verifies debate output.** `memo_verifier` runs
   inside `run_agent`; the debate never calls it. The number guard is the
   only check between a fabricated debate figure and the memo.

8. **The memo does not yet render the debate.** `bull_case`/`bear_case` are
   still "STUB" — Phase 7's job. Phase 5 delivers the transcript to the
   vault and the *caveats* to the memo, so a capped or skipped debate is
   visible; the argument itself is not.

9. **The model cannot emit an empty string into a tool call.** Asked for one
   it writes a stray `</antml parameter>` marker instead, which landed in
   `concession_trigger` on 4 of 4 live turns and tripped the concession
   guard on turns that conceded nothing. Worked around with a `'none'`
   sentinel normalized back to `""` in `domain/debate.py`. Undocumented
   behaviour, found live — if a future model stops doing it the workaround
   is harmless, but the sentinel is load-bearing today.

10. **Strict tool schemas cost the count bounds.** `strict: true` was needed
   to stop the model flattening the payload (DebateClaim fields hoisted to
   the top level, `stance` missing, on 3 of 3 turns), and it rejects
   `minItems`/`maxItems`. The 1..5 claim bound now reaches the model only as
   prose in the field description; pydantic still enforces it on the way in,
   so a violation costs the one retry rather than passing.

11. **[Cross-phase, CONFIRMED live] `technical_node` derives `as_of_date`
    from `df.index[-1]` and ignores `state["as_of_date"]`** (Phase 4 gap 6).
    The debate is the first node to read all four reports side by side, so it
    is the first place a mixed-vintage evidence pack can produce a
    confidently wrong argument.

    *Observed (AVGO, 2026-08-23):* the run was invoked `--as-of 2026-08-20`
    and the technical report came back `as_of=2026-08-21`. Six debate turns
    then argued in detail over a last close and a set of moving averages
    from **the day after the run's stated bound**, and the memo is dated
    2026-08-20. Nothing in the memo says the price evidence is from a later
    date. Not a Phase 5 bug, but Phase 5 is where it stopped being
    theoretical: the debate spent its entire transcript on a 0.15-point
    margin that belongs to a bar the run was not supposed to see.
